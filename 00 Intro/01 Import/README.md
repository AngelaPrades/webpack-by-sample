# 01 Import

In this sample we are going to start working with es6 modules (import).

We will start from sample _00 Intro/00 Boilerplate_ and add a new javascript that will
hold a simple algorithm to calculate the average of an score array.

We will use this javascript array into the main students.js file by importing
it.

Summary steps:
 - Add a new file averageService.js
 - Add an array on students.js
 - Import averageService into students.js
 - Use the averageService inside the students.js code.
 - Transpile and test on index.html
