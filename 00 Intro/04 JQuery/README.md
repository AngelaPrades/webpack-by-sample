# 04 JQuery

So far we have made good progress on our journey... but we are lacking one of the
basic pillars of web development, consuming third party libraries.

In this demo we will install a legacy library (jquery) via npm, define it as global, and use it. Finally we will end up creating a separate bundle for libraries.

We will start from sample _00 Intro/03 Output_.

Summary steps:
 - Install jquery via npm.
 - Setup a global alias ($).
 - Create some sample code using this library.
 - Break into two bundles app.js and vendor.js.  

# Steps to build it

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites, you will need to have nodejs installed in your computer. If you want to follow this step guides you will need to take as starting point sample _03 Output_.

## steps

- `npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```
npm install
```
