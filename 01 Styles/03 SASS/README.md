# 03 SASS

In this demo we rename our css file to scss extension and add a simple SASS variable. We will learn how to add a loader that can
make the SASS preprocess and then chain it to our css / style pipe.

We will start from sample _01 Styles/02 Import Bootstrap_.

Summary steps:
 - Rename mystyles.css to scss.
 - Add some SASS specific code.
 - Install a SASS preprocessor loader.
 - Add this preprocessor to the pipe (update webpack.config.js).
