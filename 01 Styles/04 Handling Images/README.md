# 04 Handling Images

In this demo we are going to include images in our project in two flavours: via
javascript and via HTML. On the javascript side we will see is something
straightforward (using the same plugins we used for fonts), for the HTML we will use a new loader html-loader

We will start from sample _01 Styles/03 SASS_.

Summary steps:
 - Add two images to our project.
 - Add the code to load the first image via javascript.
 - Configure the loader.
